# Issue: Connector Never Reaches Reconcilation Phase

# Reproducer

* Start Kafka etc:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yaml up

* Connect via remote debugger on port 5005

* Register connector, only capturing `customers` table:

    curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/ -d @register-mysql.json

* Update connector, now capturing `customers` and `orders` tables:

    curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/inventory-connector/config -d @update-mysql.json

* Update records in MySQL:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yaml exec mysql bash -c 'mysql -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD inventory'

```
update customers set first_name = 'bob123' where id = 1001;
update orders set quantity = 5 where order_number = 10001;
update customers set first_name = 'bob456' where id = 1001;
update orders set quantity = 5 where order_number = 10003;
update orders set quantity = 6 where order_number = 10003;
update customers set first_name = 'bob789' where id = 1001;
```

* Observation: still two binlog reader threads present as well as three DB history producer threads

* Expected: Only one reconciled binlog reader and one DB history producer thread
